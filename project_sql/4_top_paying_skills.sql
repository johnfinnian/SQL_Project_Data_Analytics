Sure — here’s a concise summary of the key insights:

* **Big data and AI tools lead pay growth** — skills like **PySpark, DataRobot, and Watson** command the highest salaries.
* **Integration of data and DevOps** (e.g., Bitbucket, GitLab, Jenkins, Kubernetes) is highly valued, reflecting the rise of hybrid data-engineering roles.
* **Cloud and automation platforms** (Databricks, Airflow, GCP) consistently offer strong compensation due to enterprise-scale data operations.
* **Foundational Python libraries** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) remain essential but earn slightly less compared to specialized tools.
* Overall, **multidisciplinary skill sets combining data, AI, and system automation** yield the most competitive salaries.
